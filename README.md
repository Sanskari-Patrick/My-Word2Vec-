# My-Word2Vec (Game of Thrones)
An implementation of Word2Vec from scratch. Took me quite a while because it is very memory and computationally expensive.
This implementation is done by using the Game of Thrones book dataset available on Kaggle and extensively uses Pytorch for the models and the `keras_preprocessing` library for preprocessing the text.

Comments are laid out throughout the notebook to guide you. 
Happy Coding! Any suggestions or improvements are welcome.
